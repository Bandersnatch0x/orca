 * C7.1 extracts the script one coherent group at a time, so a group that has moved still calls into
 * groups that have not. Those are declared here with the shape the moved code uses, and the
 * generator emits nothing for this file: inside the document they are the functions the remaining
 * string slices still define, and in the page's build they will be what the next group exports.
 *
 * This file only shrinks. When the last group moves it is deleted.
